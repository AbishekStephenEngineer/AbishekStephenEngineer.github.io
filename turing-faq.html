            		<p><b>What is Turing?</b></p>
            		<p>Go to <a href="https://www.turing.com/">Turing.com</a> to learn about Turing. They have tie ups with tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI and Google!</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>Is Turing legit?</b></p>
            		<p>It depends. Check if your contact sends email from domain ending in turing.com. If you are getting interviewed by any other platform, do your own research and don't get scammed by people posing as Turing employees. Turing never asks for money in any case whatsoever.</p>

            		<p><b>What are the types of jobs available at Turing?</b></p>
            		<p>You can join as a contractor (working for one of the clients of Turing) or as a member of the core team (employee of Turing). I am currently a contractor and have no idea about the core team hiring process or on campus recruitment process.</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>How is the work culture at Turing?</b></p>
            		<p>I am working as a contractor and for one of the clients of Turing. I do not work as a core member. I have no idea if you are joining as a contractor or a core member. If you are asking about my client, that is classified and I don't know who your client is or what their work culture is like. If you are joining as a core member, I am a contractor and I have no idea about FTEs.</p>

            		<p><b>Can you refer me to this job opening at Turing? Please share HR contact/Manager contact/CEO contact (really? someone did ask me this in a cold message)</b></p>
            		<p>There is no such direct referral at Turing. Even if there was, I am not going to reccommend a total stranger, even if they are a knight or a dragon or a wizard at leetcode/hackersomething or whatever. I only have a new registeration referral link and you have to complete the assessments like everyone.</p>

            		<p><b>Does Turing provide laptop for work?</b></p>
            		<p>For contractros, no. You are expected to bring your own gear. For FTE, I don't know.</p>

            		<p><b>I have doubt about on campus interview</b></p>
            		<p>I signed up and took the interview online. I have no idea what on campus interview process is like. Contact your placement cell or POC from Turing to get your doubts cleared.</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>Can I really get job as a fresher?</b></p>
            		<p>I know 3 pre-final year and final year students who started working in Turing. Note that it depends on market demand/how well you advertise yourself and your work in tech.</p>

            		<p>Have you tried telling me what you actually want instead of waiting for me to reply "Hi" to 100 new connections I get everyday? No? Then <a href="https://nohello.net/en/">this</a> page might be helpful.</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>Do they fire frequently?</b></p>
            		<p>It is like any IT job, your contract can get terminated if the company and/or project is not doing well. Turing's promise is that they will get your next contract ready asap if your current contract expires. Read Turing's FAQ for more details.</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>Is contract work good? I have only worked as an FTE till now</b></p>
            		<p>I have over 8 years of experience in tech and about 4.5 of it as an FTE, 1.5 in my own startup and 2 in Turing as a contractor. After only 2 years I can assure you that I am never going back to FTE role. One of the major advantage of working as a contractor is the amount you save in tax. Look up 44ADA presumptive taxation of Income Tax Act and Letter Of Undertaking (LUT) of GST act. As an FTE, when you earn in lakhs per month you will pay tax at the rate of ~40% or more but you only pay ~10% as a contractor. I can work from anywhere, stay out of over priced and over populated big cities and save/invest almost all of my income.</p>

        	<section>
            		<p><b>Do we need to work from office? Where is Turing office located?</b></p>
            		<p>Turing has only permenant remote jobs that you have to work from home/anywhere. Turin'g office is in California, you don't have to go there in any case.</p>

            		<p><b>I have X years of experience/I have interview coming up/My current salary is X CTC/what is Turing salary/How much should I ask as salary?/Please suggest a rate/How much does Turing pay for my tech stack?</b></p>
            		<p>I don't know. Ask Turing when you get on an inteview/call with them.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>How much is your Turing salary?</b></p>
            		<p>It's definitely higher than whatever Narayana Murthy thinks is a great salary.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Is the work hard? Do we need to put in additional hours/overtime/work over weekends?</b></p>
            		<p>It depends on your client and your contract. So far I've seen contracts requiring 40 hours a week of work only. You need to get permission to work overtime and even if you do work, you will get paid for it. Again, it depends on your contract and your client.</p>

            		<p><b>How do I prepare for Turing interview?</b></p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Can you coach/guide me on how to get selected on Turing?</b></p>
            		<p>There's thousands of resources already available. Do your own research/work.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Does Turing ask for my degree certificate/mark sheets/bonafide certificate from previous employer?</b></p>
            		<p>Nope. In Turing, if you have talent, you get the job. Note that the talent is top 1% around the world.</p>
        	</section>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>I have completed all assessments. How long will I wait? How to get selected faster?</b></p>
            		<p>Upload screenshots of your software/projects under each project you list in your Turing Developer profile. Simple as that. But it depends on market demand as well, so, God's grace and luck plays a part as well I guess?</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>How long does it take to get hired?</b></p>
            		<p>As mentioned in their FAQ, it takes around 10 days or 2 weeks, but again, it depends on market demand and your performance.</p>

            		<p><b>Your referral link is not working, it is now showing me the job.</b></p>
            		<p>The link I shared with you said "Sign up with my referral link" and it works for new sign ups only. If you have already signed up, use that account. DO NOT CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT WITH THE REFRRAL LINK! You will run into problems during ob boarding.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Are there any deductions in pay?</b></p>
            		<p>Nope. You get what you are contracted for and exactly for the hours you work. There could be forex and/or processing fee if you are cahing in to your bank account in your country's currency from USD, Otherwise, nope.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Do we get any employee benefits like dental/medical/insurance/pension?</b></p>
            		<p>As a contractor, afaik, nope. For FTE I don't know as I am a contractor.</p>

		</li>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>How many assessments should I take? How long should I perpare?</b></p>
            		<p>If you fail and assessment, you can try after 3 months. If you pass but didn't get 5 starts in the assessment (oh yeah, there's a grading system for the assessment as well. You can't see it, but the managers can in your Turing Developer profile), you can't reattempt it and you are stuck. I'd wager hiring managers tend to pick the best of the best, so prepare well for each assessment. Take your time. Do not rush. Take as many assessments you can to better your chances of getting hired. I have cleared around 12 assessments and all of them are 5 stars.</p>

		<li>
        	<section>
            		<p><b>Does Turing provide support in case of any issues?</b></p>
            		<p>In my opinion, Turing has the best support team for developers in the world. Period. I never had an issue unresolved with them for long. They are very friendly and are always looking our to help you any time. I'd say the developer support team is one of the best things in Turing.</p>

            		<p>I don't care. I have learnt to not to spend more time on things that take even more time for the return of investment. This page took me about 10 minutes to set up, I can save around an hour of answering LinkedIn messages everyday. Use Ctrl+F to search the page. Use developer option to modify the page as you like. Spend your own time.</p>
